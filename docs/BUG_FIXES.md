## Issues Fixed

### üêõ Bug #1: Disfigured Form Inputs

**Problem:**

- Input fields were appearing distorted/malformed
- Icons were appearing next to inputs instead of overlaid
- Spacing between inputs was inconsistent

**Root Cause:**
The `inputWrapper` style had `flexDirection: "row"` which caused the icon and input to display side-by-side instead of the icon being overlaid on top of the input.

**Solution:**

1. Removed `flexDirection: "row"` from `inputWrapper`
2. Created a new style `inputWithIcon` with proper padding for icon space
3. Updated `inputIconRight` positioning to be properly centered
4. Added `marginBottom` to both `autocompleteContainer` and `inputWrapper` for consistent spacing

**Changes Made:**

```typescript
// BEFORE
inputWrapper: {
  position: "relative",
  flexDirection: "row",  // ‚ùå This caused side-by-side layout
  alignItems: "center",
}

// AFTER
inputWrapper: {
  position: "relative",
  marginBottom: 12,  // ‚úÖ Proper spacing
}

// NEW STYLE
inputWithIcon: {
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: "#00AA66",
  borderRadius: 10,
  padding: 12,
  paddingRight: 44,  // ‚úÖ Room for icon
  fontSize: 15,
}
```

### üêõ Bug #2: Bank Selection Requires Double-Tap

**Problem:**

- User selects a bank from dropdown
- Bank appears to be selected visually
- But form doesn't register the selection
- User must tap the same bank again for it to actually select

**Root Cause:**
State updates were happening in the wrong order. The dropdown was closing and keyboard dismissing AFTER the selection state was set, causing React to lose track of the state updates.

**Solution:**
Reorganized the `handleBankSelect` function to:

1. Close dropdown first
2. Dismiss keyboard
3. Then update all related states in proper order
4. Use functional setState to preserve existing form values

**Changes Made:**

```typescript
// BEFORE
const handleBankSelect = (bank: IBank) => {
  setSelectedBank(bank);
  setForm({
    ...form, // ‚ùå Direct spread could lose updates
    bankName: bank.name,
    slug: bank.slug,
    bankCode: bank.code,
    bankHoldersName: "",
  });
  setBankSearchQuery(bank.name);
  setShowBankDropdown(false); // ‚ùå Closing dropdown after state updates
  setAccountValidated(false);
  Keyboard.dismiss(); // ‚ùå Dismissing keyboard last
};

// AFTER
const handleBankSelect = (bank: IBank) => {
  // Close dropdown first
  setShowBankDropdown(false); // ‚úÖ Close immediately
  Keyboard.dismiss(); // ‚úÖ Dismiss keyboard immediately

  // Then update all states
  setSelectedBank(bank);
  setBankSearchQuery(bank.name);
  setForm((prev) => ({
    // ‚úÖ Functional setState preserves values
    ...prev,
    bankName: bank.name,
    slug: bank.slug,
    bankCode: bank.code,
    bankHoldersName: "",
    accountNumber: prev.accountNumber, // ‚úÖ Keep existing account number
  }));
  setAccountValidated(false);
};
```

## Technical Details

### State Update Order (Critical)

The order of state updates in `handleBankSelect` is now:

1. UI Actions (close dropdown, dismiss keyboard)
2. Selection State (selected bank, search query)
3. Form State (using functional setState)
4. Validation State (reset validation)

This order ensures React can properly track and apply all state changes without conflicts.

### Input Styling Strategy

- **Regular inputs**: Use `styles.input` (no icon)
- **Inputs with icons**: Use `styles.inputWithIcon` (has right padding)
- **Disabled inputs**: Combine with `styles.inputDisabled`
- **Icon positioning**: Absolute with `top: 12px, right: 16px`

### Spacing System

- Input wrapper: `marginBottom: 12px`
- Autocomplete container: `marginBottom: 12px`
- Individual inputs: No bottom margin (handled by wrapper)
- Form container: `marginBottom: 20px`

## Files Modified

1. `/app/payment/methods.tsx`
   - Updated `handleBankSelect` function
   - Added `inputWithIcon` style
   - Updated `inputWrapper` style
   - Updated `autocompleteContainer` style
   - Updated `inputIconRight` positioning
   - Changed all relevant TextInput components to use `inputWithIcon`

## Screenshots

### Issue #1: Disfigured Inputs

**Before:** Icons and inputs side-by-side, spacing inconsistent
**After:** Icons overlaid, proper spacing, professional appearance

### Issue #2: Double-Tap Bug

**Before:** Required 2 taps to select bank
**After:** Single tap works correctly

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always close UI elements first** (dropdowns, keyboards) before updating related state
2. **Use functional setState** when new state depends on previous state
3. **Keep icons absolutely positioned** within relative containers
4. **Add proper padding** to inputs that have overlaid icons
5. **Test state updates** by logging or using React DevTools
6. **Maintain consistent spacing** using wrapper components
